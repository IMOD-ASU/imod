### Editor Guidelines
Please install the [Editor Config plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for your prefered editor to assist with uniform code style

### Git Guidelines
Please follow the [Git Flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

### Issue Guidelines
A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
3. Isolate the problem — create a reduced test case and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:
> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

### Code Guidelines
Front end code should be written in [HTML5](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) following the [Google style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml) (using tabs instead of two spaces)

When creating pages, HTML is for content, Cascading Stylesheets are for presentation, Javascript is for events and state. Keep these languages each in their seperate files.

Follow the [Zen of Python](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
> Beautiful is better than ugly.
>
> Explicit is better than implicit.
>
> Simple is better than complex.
>
> Complex is better than complicated.
>
> Flat is better than nested.
>
> Sparse is better than dense.
>
> Readability counts.
>
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
>
> Although practicality beats purity.
>
> Errors should never pass silently.
>
> Unless explicitly silenced.
>
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
>
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
>
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
>
> Now is better than never.
>
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
>
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
>
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

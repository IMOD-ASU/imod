				<h1>Welcome to IMOD&trade;</h1>
				<p>The Instructional Module Development (IMOD&trade;)
					system guides instructors, step-by-step, through an
					outcome-based education process as they define learning
					objectives, select content to be covered, and define the
					learning environment and context for their course(s). The
					IMOD&trade; software system uses Semantic Web technologies
					to provide intelligent interactions with users; dictate a
					course design process in conformance with the underlying
					framework and provides feedback to the user on their
					course design.

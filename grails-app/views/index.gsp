				The Instructional Module Development (IMOD&trade;)
				system guides instructors, step-by-step, through an
				outcome-based education process as they define learning
				objectives, select content to be covered, and define the
				learning environment and context for their course(s). The
				IMOD&trade; software system uses Semantic Web technologies
				to provide intelligent interactions with users; dictate a
				course design process in conformance with the underlying
				framework and provides feedback to the user on their
				course design.
